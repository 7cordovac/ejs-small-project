# ejs-small-project

###
 - Objective: Using your "seminar" database, populate views with "get all" and "get one" routes.

### Getting started:
In your command line, type the following:
```
express miniEJSProject --view=ejs --git
cd miniEJSProject
npm install
nodemon
```

### Base Goal: 
 - Create the "get/show all" route for professors and supporting view.
### Stretch Goal: 
 - Create the "get/show one" route for professors and supporting view. 
### Stretch Goal: 
 - If on the "get/show all" view, one of the professors is clicked, the user is taken to the "get/show one" route for that professor, which lists all of the seminars that they are teaching at.
### Stretch Goal:
 - On the "get/show one" route for professors, list where that professor is from.
